Iâ€™m Aayush Agrawal, a first-year undergraduate part of The Abhiyaan Team.  

We are honoured to invite you to collaborate with Project Abhiyaan.

The Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IITM) epitomises 60 years of unstinting innovations and technical contributions to Indian society. It is one of the foremost institutes of national importance in higher technological education and basic and applied research. 

Team Abhiyaan is an enthusiastic group of multi-disciplinary students of IIT Madras, committed to building intelligent, robust, precise, and safe ground navigation systems.

	2. Increasing Outreach and Brand Value - This collaboration will ensure an increase in the outreach of PCB Power products among students. 

What we are looking for from PCB Power:
